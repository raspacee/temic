# temic

## A simple text editor based on C.

### Extending the work of kilo by [antirez](https://github.com/antirez).
### Also special thanks to [snaptoken](https://github.com/paileyq) for explaining some of the code.

## Usage

- Compile using the 'make' command and run './kilo [filename]'

## TODO

- [x] Modularize the code.
- [ ] Support more filetypes for syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Read from a config file to make things more configurable.
- [x] Display line numbers.
- [ ] Auto Indenting.
- [ ] Normal and editing mode just like in vim.
- [ ] Much more ?
