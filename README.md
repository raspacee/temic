# temic

## A simple commandline text editor based on C.

### Project originally called kilo by [antirez](https://github.com/antirez).
### Some code changes made by [snaptoken](https://github.com/paileyq) for explaining some of the code.

## Usage

- Compile using the 'make' command and run './temic [filename]'

## Use case
- This program can't replace text editors like vim or nano, but you can study the code to understand how text editors can be created

## TODO

- [x] Modularize the code.
- [x] Support more filetypes for syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Read from a config file to make things more configurable.
- [x] Display line numbers.
- [x] Auto Indenting.
- [x] Normal and editing mode just like in vim.
- [ ] Much more ?
